WSL2 provides a convenient and stable Linux development environment for working
on embedded systems firmware. If you’re curious about toolchain performance,
check out [this comparison of firmware development environments](https://interrupt.memfault.com/blog/comparing-fw-dev-envs),
but the summary is that WSL2 is about 2x the speed of Windows and similar to
“bare metal” Linux. Setup time for WSL2 will vary based on your Windows
configuration, typically taking 10 to 30 minutes.
